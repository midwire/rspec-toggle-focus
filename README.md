This is basically a port of the Sublime Text package written by [axsuul](https://packagecontrol.io/browse/authors/axsuul), in Python, which is  [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Toggle%20RSpec%20Focus)

## Notes

This is my first Atom plugin and I am not very experienced with Coffeescript, so please let me know if I it breaks or if I can do something in a better way.

I didn't have time to figure out how the Jasmine specs work. Please feel free to help out with those, by forking and submitting a pull request.
